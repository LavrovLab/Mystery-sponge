# README.md
18S and 28S sequences were assembled using 500K sequences (resulting in longest rRNA sequences)
There was just one contig corresponding to 18S rRNA, but 3 contigs corresponding to 28S rRNA.
Two 28S contigs were almost identical except for an internal sequence, which showed some differences.
This middle section was 68.1% similar to aq sequence for NODE66 and 67.9% similar for NODE67. 
Also the coverage of these nodes were 332 and 304, respectively.
So NODE66 was used as the representative sequence.
